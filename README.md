# Url Query Comparison

https://url-query-comparison.nataxo.now.sh

Aloha! My simple tool helps you to compare query parameters from large urls.

## Useful notes
* Passed `Ignore params` will be saved in localStorage.\
* Use `Enter` to make compare urls instead of click.\
* Each param value from result tables is copied in Clipboard by click.

Hope you enjoy!
